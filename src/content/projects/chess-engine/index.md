This project features a chess engine built using TypeScript - a high level language, in stark contrast to the low level languages typically found to be used to build chess engines. This allows for a greater emphasis and easier understanding of the concepts behind artificial intelligence design while providing much greater code readability.

_This project is based on my final year project at university._

A playable game can be found at [chess-game](/portfolio/project/chess-game).
